        The main point to access the Flip framework. When your application is 
        started you should create <a href="FeatureService.html">FeatureService</a>. 
        There are two options to do this:
        <ol>
            <li>Using <a href="FeatureServiceReflectionFactory.html">FeatureServiceReflectionFactory</a> 
                which will scan for the classes in the packages passed which are annotated
                with <a href="context/FlipContext.html">FlipContext</a> annotation
                or with <a href="properties/FlipProperty.html">FlipProperty</a> annotation.
                Also it by default adds the <a href="properties/XmlPropertyReader.html">XmlPropertyReader</a>
                and <a href="context/SystemPropertiesContextProvider.html">SystemPropertiesContextProvider</a>.
                After that it orders them by priority specified in the annotation and instantiates
                <a href="context/ContextManager.html">ContextManager</a> and <a href="properties/PropertyManager.html">PropertyManager</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Using <a href="FeatureServiceDirectFactory.html">FeatureServiceDirectFactory</a> which
                should be initialized by a DI or yourself. Here you should set the
                context providers and property readers in the order you like. Also you will have
                to set properties used to configure the property readers.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </body>
