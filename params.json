{"name":"Flip","body":"## Flip - feature toggling framework\r\n\r\nFlip is embracing the concept of [Feature Toggle](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html),\r\nand brings it into the Java world.\r\n\r\nThere are a several ways that this can be used, including:\r\n\r\n1. Reducing the need to branch by feature in git by having all work done on master. Features that are not ready for production can be disabled.\r\n2. Features will eventually be enabled or disabled per user group, enabling closed betas.\r\n3. Should a feature become problematic, we can turn it off without requiring a build and deploy.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\n## Ant\r\n\r\nIf you application is built using Ant you should copy the following libraries\r\nto your project library folder:\r\n\r\n1. flip-core-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar (the core library itself)\r\n2. commons-collections-3.2.1.jar from http://commons.apache.org/collections/\r\n3. commons-jexl-2.1.1.jar from http://commons.apache.org/jexl/\r\n4. commons-lang3-3.1.jar from http://commons.apache.org/lang/\r\n5. commons-logging-1.1.1.jar from http://commons.apache.org/logging/\r\n6. reflections-0.9.6.jar from http://code.google.com/p/reflections/\r\n7. dom4j-1.6.1.jar from http://dom4j.sourceforge.net/\r\n8. guava-10.0.jar from http://dom4j.sourceforge.net/\r\n9. javassist-3.12.1.GA.jar from http://www.javassist.org/\r\n\r\n## Maven\r\n\r\nIf you build your application using maven you simply add the following dependency:\r\n\r\n    <dependency>\r\n        <groupId>com.tacitknowledge</groupId>\r\n        <artifactId>flip</artifactId>\r\n        <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\r\n    </dependency>\r\n\r\nor each module separately:\r\n\r\n    <dependency>\r\n        <groupId>com.tacitknowledge.flip</groupId>\r\n        <artifactId>core</artifactId>\r\n        <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\r\n    </dependency>\r\n    \r\n    <dependency>\r\n        <groupId>com.tacitknowledge.flip</groupId>\r\n        <artifactId>servlet</artifactId>\r\n        <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\r\n    </dependency>\r\n    \r\n    <dependency>\r\n        <groupId>com.tacitknowledge.flip</groupId>\r\n        <artifactId>spring</artifactId>\r\n        <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\r\n    </dependency>\r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\n\r\nThe documentation for Flip is on the [Flip Wiki](https://github.com/tacitknowledge/flip/wiki)\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\nAfter you added the library to the project tree you have to integrate it. \r\nFirstly you should instantiate the `com.tacitknowledge.flip.FeatureService`\r\nobject by using one of two default factories:\r\n\r\n1. `FeatureServiceReflectionFactory` - as the name implies, it leverages capabilities\r\nof reflection to perform lookup process, identifying context providers and property readers defined\r\nwithing the system.\r\n2. `FeatureServiceDirectFactory` - this factory expects that required entities will be provided, leaving\r\nresponsibility of initialization of `context providers` and `property readers` to the underlying DI framework,\r\nor to the developer. \r\n\r\nAfter you started the feature service you have to place the invocations to\r\nfeature service to obtain the feature state in that places of your code \r\nwhere is needed. These steps are specific for your project and they do not \r\nhave a default implementations.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to define the feature states. This could be done by using\r\nthe default property reader `XmlPropertyReader` or by implementing your own.\r\nXmlPropertyReader obtains the feature descriptors from XML file which could\r\nbe placed in your project.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Licensing\r\n\r\nThis framework is released under Apache 2.0 Public License.

Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)\r\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\r\n5.
